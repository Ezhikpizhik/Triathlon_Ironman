What i learned from doing triathlon and analyzing the race data:

- The significance test showed with 95% confidence that the population gender difference in total race time is between 10 and 20 mins.
- Hypothesis testing for difference in means of total time by gender confirmed that men finish the race faster (stat. sig.).
- Men on average are faster in all of the activities. The difference is more pronounced in the longer activity.
- Biking performance has the strongest correlation with the overall rank. Swimming segment is the least predictable for the final rank. Thus, such race inadvertently favors bikers & runners over swimmers.
- If the median duration of each activity was the same, let’s say 1 hour, one would have to emphasize the performance in running and swimming segments, less so in biking.
- There is a strong correlation between transition time and race total time. The better athletes tend to optimize the transition from one activity to another.
- Life hack: In order to perform well overall you need to perform well in biking and running, swimming is less important for the overall rank.
